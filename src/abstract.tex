Our real-time continuous gesture recognition system addresses problems that
have previously been neglected: handling both gestures that are
characterized by distinct paths and gestures characterized by distinct hand
poses; and determining how and when the system should respond to gestures. Our probabilistic 
recognition framework based on hidden
Markov models (HMMs) unifies the recognition of the two forms of gestures.
Using information from the
hidden states in the HMM, we can identify different
gesture phases: the pre-stroke, the nucleus and the post-stroke
phases.
This allows the system to respond appropriately to both gestures that
require a discrete response and those needing a continuous response.
Our system is extensible: in only a few minutes, users can define their own
gestures by giving a few examples rather than writing code.
We also collected a new gesture dataset that
contains the two forms of gestures, and propose a new hybrid performance
metric for evaluating gesture recognition methods for real-time
interaction.
