\chapter{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}
We evaluate our method based on the development data set from the ChAirGest
corpus~\cite{Ruffieux2013} with gestures captured from 10 users. There are
10 different gestures and 3 resting positions. There are 900 total gesture
occurrences (3 recording sessions for each user) in the development data set representing three forth of the entire corpus. The remaining one forth of the corpus are not released to
the public, and can be used for final evaluation on unseen data.

In this data set, on average, the hand is at 1.2m away
from the sensor, which means the depth error is around 5mm.

A frame-based accuracy score can be biased because a classifier that
favors longer gestures would have higher accuracy.

\textit{Precision} (P) corresponds to the number of correctly detected events
divided by the number of returned events and the \textit{Recall} metric
corresponds to the number of correctly detected events divided by the number of
events in the ground truth. \cite{Ruffieux2013}

If we only use motion features such as relative position, velocity and
acceleration, the result is poor because it cannot distinguish gestures with
the same path but different hand postures such as ``Wave Hello'' and ``Shake
Hand'', ``Circle Palm Rotation'' and ``Circle Palm Down''.

``Take from Screen'' and ``Push to Screen'' have the lowest recognition
accuracy, especially when using the kienct data. We notice that when the users
extend their hands towards the screen, the hands are too close to the sensor
(below the too near range), and the depth sensor cannot get accurate readings.

We evaluate our method based on the dataset we collected, using the
evaluation metrics proposed in the previous section. The evaluation is based
on the assumption that all the gestures with distinct paths (gesture \#1--4)
are discrete flow gestures, and gestures with distinct hand poses (gesture
\#5--7) are continuous flow gestures. 

Our survey results show that it is
important to allow users to quickly define and train their own gestures. Hence,
we evaluate our system using user dependent training and testing. For each user
in the dataset, we use the first 2 sessions of recording (6 samples per gesture)
as training examples, and the last 2 sessions as testing examples.
Fig.~\ref{fig:recog-result} shows a visualization of the recognition result on a
test sequence. The figure highlights the challenges in the test sequences:
there are 21 gestures in each continuous unsegmented sequence; sometimes
gestures immediately follow one another.

We report the average test results for 10 users.

\section{Compare Different Topologies}
In our unified framework, is it necessary to
treat gestures with distinct hand poses differently from gestures with
distinct paths? Table~\ref{tab:result} compares the results between two topologies. The first
row is the result from treating the two forms of gestures in the same way,
i.e., all gestures have the same left-right Bakis model for their nucleus
phases. The second row is the result from using a left-right Bakis model for
gestures with distinct paths and a single state for gestures with distinct hand
poses.
As Table~\ref{tab:result} shows, having different HMM topologies for the two forms of gestures significantly increases the precision, recall and F1 score for gestures with
distinct hand poses.

For gestures with arbitrary movement, it is difficult to use embedded training
to accurately align pre-stroke, nucleus and post-stroke phases.
Figure~\ref{fig:palm-hidden} illustrates this problem. It shows the most likely
hidden state estimates for a ``palm up'' gesture sequence. The main (center)
part of the gesture is identified as the post-stroke of the gesture.

standard deviations. The results are based on using 3 mixtures of Gaussians
for the emission probabilities, and lag time $L = 8$ frames.}
\label{tab:result}
\end{table}

\section{Compare different number of mixtures}
The previous section shows that using different topologies for gestures
with distinct paths and gestures with distinct hand poses give better
recognition performance. So using this model, we investigate the effects
of the number of mixtures ($k$) for the emission probabilities.

First, we set $k$ be the same for both forms of gestures.
Fig.~\ref{fig:mixtures} shows that the F1 scores increases as the number of mixtures ($k$) increases until $k=3$.
After that, we start to see the effect of overfitting.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim=10mm 5mm 10mm 15mm,
clip, width=\columnwidth]{figures/f1_nM.png}
\caption{F1 scores versus number of mixtures.}
\label{fig:mixtures}
\end{figure}

Then, we experiment with using different $k$s for gestures with distinct paths
and gestures with distinct hand poses. We set $k_\text{path} = 3$ for
gestures with distinct paths, and use a different $k_{\text{pose}, g}$ for
gesture, $g$, with a distinct pose, because some hand poses may have more
variation than others.
For example, the ``point'' gesture may have more variation in orientations than the ``grab'' gesture
(hand in fist), we Bayesian Information Criteria
(BIC)~\cite{fraley06} to choose $k_{\text{pose}, g}$.

To estimate the mixture of Gaussians model for a gesture with distinct hand
poses, we iterate through a range of values for $k$ (3 -- 6
were used in our experiments), and compute the BIC in each iteration. The BIC has the
form~\cite{fraley06}
\begin{align}
BIC\eqdef 2\text{loglik}_\mathcal{M}(\underline{x}_1^n, \theta_k^*) - (\#
\text{params})_\mathcal{M} \log(n) \\
\end{align}
where $\text{loglik}_\mathcal{M}(\underline{x}_1^n, \theta_k^*)$ is the
maximized loglikelihood for the model and data, $(\#
\text{params})_\mathcal{M}$ is the number of independent parameters to be
estimated in the model $\mathcal{M}$, and $n$ is the number of observations in
the data. Let $d$ be the feature dimension for one frame, then $\mu_{s,m}$ for
hidden state $s$ and mixture $m$ has $d$ independent parameters, and the
diagonal covariance matrix $\Sigma_{s,m}$ has $d$ independent parameters as
well. Because $\sum_{m=1}^k q(m | s) = 1$, the number of independent parameters
for the weights $q(m|s)$ is $k - 1$. Hence,
\begin{align}
\#\text{params} = k - 1 + (d + d) * k
\end{align}

Because the EM algorithm can converge to a local maximum of the observed-data
likelihood~\cite{dicintio12}, we repeat the optimization 3 times for each
$k_\text{pose},g$, and choose the model that gives the highest loglikelihood.
Using this method, we are able to improve the F1 and Responsiveness scores even further (see Table~\ref{tab:different-mixtures}).

%Compare user dependent vs user independent result

\section{Compare Different Lag Times}
Fig.\ref{fig:lag} shows how the F1 scores change with respect to the lag time
($L$) in fixed-lag smoothing. The performance increases as $L$ increases, and
plateaus at $L=8$ frames which is about 0.3s at 30 FPS. This shows that more
evidence does help to smooth the estimates until a limit, and we do not need to
sacrifice too much delay to reach the limit. Our result also shows that the
responsiveness score stays around 0.6-0.7 seconds as we increase $L$.

\includegraphics[trim=0 5mm 0 15mm, clip,
width=\columnwidth]{figures/f1_lag.png}
\caption{F1 scores versus lag time.}
\label{fig:lag}
\end{figure}

Our system is fast to train as well. The average computation time for training
the model for one user is about 5s with 7 gestures and 6 training examples per
gesture.

Detect events

There are big variations in the recognition results for the pose gestures among
users: the highest F1 score is 0.81 and the lowest is 0.58. Most confusions are among the 3 pose gestures, especially when there is
significant motion blur (see Figure~\ref{fig:point_grab}). We observe that
the low scores also corresponds to users who move relatively fast when doing the
pose gestures. This suggests that users may need to perform pose gestures
relatively slowly in order to get better recognition results.
