\chapter{Review of Dynamic Bayesian Network}\label{app:dbn}
This part is mainly based on the Ph.D. thesis by Murphy \cite{murphy02}.

A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)~\cite{dean89} is a way to extend Bayes nets to
model probability distribution over semi-infinite collection  of random variables. An
HMM is a stochastic finite automaton, where each state generates (emits) an observation. If we let $S_t$ represent the hidden state at time $t$, the
transition model between states can be characterized by a conditional
multinomial distribution: $A(i, j) = P(S_t = j | S_{t-1} = i)$, where $A$ is a
stochastic matrix.

\section{Inference}
Normalize $\alpha$, so that $\alpha_t(i) = P(X_t = i | y_{1:t})$ which always
sums to one over $X_t$. Sum of $\beta_t = P(y_{t+1:T}|X_t)$ over $X_t$ need not
be one.

\section{Filtering}
The most common inference problem in online analysis is to recursively estimate
the belief state using Bayes's rule:

\begin{align*}
P(S_t | x_{1:t}) & \propto P(x_t | S_t, x_{1:t-1})P(S_t | x_{1:t-1}) \\
         & = P(x_t | S_t) \left[\sum_{s_{t - 1}}
           P(S_t | s_{t - 1})P(s_{t - 1} | x_{1:t - 1})\right]
\end{align*}

This task is traditionally called ``filtering'', because we are filtering out
the noise from the observations. We can find this value using the forward
algorithm.

\section{Classification}
The likelihood of a model, $M$, is $P(x_{1:t}|M)$. This can be used to classify
a sequence as follows:
\begin{align*}
C^*(x_{1:T}) = \arg \max_{C} P(x_{1:T} | C)P(C)
\end{align*}
