\chapter{Review of State-space Model}\label{app:dbn} State-space models (e.g.,
HMMs) are used to model sequential data. A dynamic Bayesian network\footnote{This part is mainly based on the Kevin Murphy's Ph.D. thesis~\cite{murphy02}.} (DBN)~\cite{dean89} 
provides an expressive language for representing
state-space models. It is a way to extend
Bayes nets to model probability distribution over semi-infinite collection  of
random variables. 

\section{Representation}
Let $S_t$ be the hidden state and $X_t$ be the observation at time $t$.
Any state-space model must define a prior, $P(S_1)$, a state-transition function, $P(S_t|S_{t-1})$, and an observation function, $P(X_t|S_t)$. An HMM
is one way of representing state-space models.

\section{Inference}\label{sec:inference}
A state-space model is a model of how $S_t$ generates or ``causes'' $X_t$ and
$S_{t+1}$. The goal of inference is to invert this mapping, i.e., to infer
$S_{1:t}$ given $X_{1:t}$. There are many kinds of inference one can perform on
state-space models. Here I list the ones that are relevant to this thesis. See
Figure~\ref{fig:inference} for a summary.

\subsection{Filtering}
The most common inference problem in online analysis is to recursively estimate
the current belief state at time $t$ using Bayes's rule:
\begin{align*}
P(S_t | x_{1:t}) & \propto P(x_t | S_t, x_{1:t-1})P(S_t | x_{1:t-1}) \\
         & = P(x_t | S_t) \left[\sum_{s_{t - 1}}
           P(S_t | s_{t - 1})P(s_{t - 1} | x_{1:t - 1})\right]
\end{align*}
This task is traditionally called ``filtering'', because we are filtering out
the noise from the observations. We can find this value using the forward
algorithm.

\subsection{Smoothing}
Smoothing means we use all the evidence up to the current time to estimate the
state of the past, i.e., compute $P(S_{t-l}|x_{1:t})$, where $l>0$ is the lag.
This is traditionally called ``fixed-lag smoothing''. In the offline case, this
is called (fixed-interval) smoothing which corresponds to computing
$P(S_t|x_{1:T})$ for all $1\leq t\leq T$.

\subsection{Viterbi Decoding}
In Vertibi decoding (computing the ``most probable explanation''), the goal is
to compute the most likely sequence of hidden states give the data:
\begin{align*}
s_{1:t}^* = \arg\max_{s_{1:t}}P(s_{1:t}|x_{1:t})
\end{align*}

\subsection{Classification}
The likelihood of a model, $\theta$, is $P(x_{1:t}|\theta)$. This can be used to
classify a sequence as follows:
\begin{align*}
C^*(x_{1:T}) = \arg \max_{C} P(x_{1:T} | \theta_C)P(C)
\end{align*}
where $P(x_{1:t}|\theta_C)$ is the likelihood to the model for class $C$, and 
$P(C)$ is the prior for class $C$. This method ahs the advantage of being able
to handle sequences of variable-length. By contrast, most classifiers work with
fixed-size feature vectors.
