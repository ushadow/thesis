\chapter{Review of F-measure}\label{app:fmeasure}
In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F-measure is a measure of
test's accuracy, combining both the precision and the recall of the test.
Precision is the number of correct results divided by
the number of all returned results, and recall is the number of correct
results divided by the number of results that should have been
returned~\cite{f1score14}. Note that both precision and recall have the same
numerator.

The general formula for F-measure is
\begin{align*}
F_\beta &= (1 + \beta^2)\cdot\frac{\text{precision}\cdot
\text{recall}}{(\beta^2\cdot\text{precision}) + \text{recall}}\\
&= \frac{1 + \beta^2}{\frac{1}{\text{precision}}+\frac{\beta^2}{\text{recall}}}
\end{align*}
which is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. The $F_1$ score
($\beta=1$) is the most commonly used one where precision and recall have
equal weight:
\begin{align*}
F_1 = 2\cdot\frac{\text{precision}\cdot
\text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}
\end{align*}
Two other commonly used F measures are the $F_2$ measure, which weighs recall
higher than precision, and the $F_{0.5}$ measure, which puts more emphasis on
precision than recall.
