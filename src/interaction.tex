\chapter{Gesture Interaction}
\section{Continuous and Discrete Gestures}
How to handle continuous and discrete gestures in an unified probabilistic
framework. Use hand poses to distinguish continuous and discrete gestures.
Unlike \cite{Oka02} et al., hand poses are selected based on naturalness.

\section{Gesture and Speech}
Traditionally, gestures are used to augment speech in interaction, as pioneered
by Bolt's ``Put That There'' system \cite{Bolt80}. Our previous user study
\cite{yin10thesis} show that speech also can augment gestures.

We use an off-the-shelf speech 
recognizer, and investigate how to combine both speech and gesture to make
the interaction more natural and effortless. Specifically, we will explore how speech and gestures complement each other in certain scenarios.
