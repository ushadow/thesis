\chapter{Notation and abbreviations}
We adopt the standard convention that random variables are denoted as captial
letters, and instantiations of random variables (values) are denoted as
lower-case letters. We use underlines for vector-valued quantities to
distinguish them from scalar-valued ones. So $x$ refers to a scalar, while
$\underline{x}$ refers to a vector. We use caligraphic letters to denote sets.
