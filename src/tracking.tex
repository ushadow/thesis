\chapter{Hand Tracking}\section{Kinect Sensor}The depth sensor data from the Kinect is quite noisy. For a static scene, theaverage absolute pixel difference from the RGB camera is about 0.6\% of the maximum value (8bits), while the average absolute depth difference per pixel is about 4.2\%(347.89mm) of the maximum value (13 bits).The random error of depth measurements increases quadratically with increasing distance from the sensor and ranges from a few millimeters at 0.5m distance to about 4cmat the maximum range of 5 meters \cite{khoshelham2011}.With default range, the depth sensor has a normal range limit of about 0.8m -4m.\begin{figure}[h]\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/kinect_sensor_range.png}\caption{Kinect depth sensor range \cite{microsoft-kinect}.}\end{figure}\section{Hand Tracking for Tabletop}\subsection{System Setup}The custom tabletop structure includes four $1280\times1024$ pixel projectors (Dell 5100MP) that provide a $2560\times2048$ pixel resolution display. Thedisplay is projected onto a flat white surface digitizer (GTCO Calcomp DrawingBoard V), which uses a stylus as an input device. The digitizer is tilted 10 degrees down in front, and is placed at 41in (104cm) above the floor, following FAA's design standard to accommodate the $5^{th}$ through $95^{th}$ percentiles of population. The projected displays were mechanically aligned to produce a single seamless large display area. The graphics card used is AMDRadeon\texttrademark{TM} HD 6870 and the operating system used is Ubuntu 11.10.\begin{figure}  \centering  \subfigure[] {	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/setup1.png}   }  \subfigure[] {  	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/setup_close.png}  }  \caption{System setup.} \label{fig:setup}\end{figure}One Kinect motion sensor by Microsoft is placed above the center of the tabletopat the same level of the projectors. Figure~\ref{fig:setup} shows the setup. TheKinect sensor has a RGB camera, a depth sensor and a multi-array microphone.We use the depth sensor to capture hand motion data because it isless sensitive to the lighting condition. This is particularly useful for ourprojection system. The Dell 5100MP projector uses a spinning color wheel tomodulate the image. This produces a visible artifact on the screen, referred to as the ``rainbow effect'', with colors separating out in distinct red, green, and blue. At any given instant in time, the image on the screen is either red, or green, or blue,and the technology relies upon people's eyes not being able to detect the rapid changes from one to the other. However, when seen through a RGB camera, theeffect is very obvious, and this can greatly affect hand segmentation if we were to use the RGB images. The Kinect sensor outputs video at a frame rate of 30Hz. The depth sensing videostream has a resolution of $640\times 480$ pixels with 11-bit depth value. Thedepth value increases as the distance of the object from the sensor increases.The tabletop surface is about 1.2m away from the Kinectsensor which allows us to have a relatively good depth resolution. We use theopen source OpenNI framework \footnote{https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI} and itsKinect driver \footnote{https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect} to get both the depth and RGB data streams.\subsection{Kinect Calibration}In order to develop an interactive interface, we need to map the point in thedepth image to the point on the display. We do this by projecting acheckerboard image on the tabletop display, and placing some wooden blocks atthe corners of the checkerboard image to create the depth differences so that the depth sensor can capture these corners (see Figure~\ref{fig:calibration}).We manually labeled 16 pairs of corresponding points on the display and the depth image. Then weapply undistortion to the depth image and planar homography to find the mapping.\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/calibration.png}   \caption{Kinect calibration. The darker squares are the wooden blocks. The  intensity of the gray level image is inversely proportional to the distance  from the Kinect sensor.}  \label{fig:calibration}\end{figure}Planar homography is a projective mapping from one plane to another. In ourcase, we are mapping points on the plane of the depth image to the pointson the plane of the display. To evaluate the result of the calibration, weobtain a new set of manually labeled corresponding points on the display and thedepth image. We then transform the coordinates of the points on the depth imageto the coordinates on the display using the calibration result, and find theEuclean distance (error) between the transformed coordinates and the labeledcoordinates of the points on the display. The average errors in the x-axis andy-axis are 4.3px and 8.9px respectively, which are 0.21cm, and 0.4cm in physical distance of theprojected display. The average width of the index fingertip is about 1.4cm, sothe error is less than 30\% of the width of the fingertip. \subsection{Hand Tracking}The hand tracking process consists of feature detection and parameter estimation. The hand trackingpipeline consists the following steps:\begin{enumerate}  \item Background subtraction  \item Forelimb and hand segmentation  \item Fingertips tracking\end{enumerate}The following subsections explain in details about these steps. Many of thecomputer vision methods we use are based on the OpenCV\footnote{http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/} library and its Java interface JavaCV \footnote{http://code.google.com/p/javacv/}.\subsubsection{Background Subtraction}While the background - i.e., the tabletop - is relatively static, there isstill noise from the depth sensor. We use the averaging background method, whichlearns the average and average difference of each pixel in the depth image asthe model of the background. The average values are based on the initial 30frames with no hands in the scene. For the subsequent frames, any value that is 6 times the average frame-to-frame absolute difference below the average tabletop depth value for that pixel is considered foreground because it is closer to the sensor above.To clean up the background subtracted depth image, we use 1 iteration ofmorphological opening to clear out small pixel noise. Morphological opening is acombination of erosion and dilation. Both erosion and dilation are morphologicaltransformations. The kernel of erosion is a \textit{local minimum} operator,while that of dilation is a \textit{local maximum} operator.\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \subfigure[Without using morphological opening.] {	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/background_subtraction.png}   }  \subfigure[Using morphological opening to clear out small pixel noise.] {  	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/morphology.png}  }  \caption{Background subtraction.} \label{fig:setup}\end{figure}\subsubsection{Forelimb and Hand Segmentation}With the cleaned up background subtracted depth image, we find connectedcomponents by finding all contours that are not too small. These components areconsidered to be the forelimbs and are approximated with convex hulls and bounding boxes. The hand region is at either end of the bounding box dependingon the position of the arm relative to the table.\subsubsection{Fingertips Tracking}We base our estimation of the hand model on geometric properties of thehand. We compute the convexity defects from the convex hull of the forelimb(Figure \ref{fig:convexity_defects}). From this we can observe that for anextended finger, it has one convexity defect on each side and the two adjacent sides of the defects form anacute angle. We iterate through the adjacent convexity defects, and mark theintersection of those sides that form an angle smaller than a thresholdvalue as the potential fingertip. We further refine the fingertip position bysearching in the general direction of the finger and finding a sharp change inthe gradient of the depth value.\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/convexity_defects2.png}   \caption{The white triangles are the convexity defects.}  \label{fig:convexity_defects}\end{figure}\subsubsection{Kalman Filter}We use a Kalman filter to further improve tracking accuracy. The dynamic stateof the fingertip can be summarized by a $4$-dimensional vector, $x_k$, includingtwo position variables, $x$ and $y$, and two velocities, $v_x$ and $v_y$. Themeasurement is a $2$-dimensional vector, $z_k$, of the measured $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the fingertip.Assuming no external control, the a priori estimate $x_k^-$ of the state isgiven by:\begin{align*}x_k^- = Fx_{k - 1} + w_k\end{align*}$F$ is the $4$-by-$4$ \textit{transfer matrix} characterizing thedynamics of the system with the following values:\begin{align*}x_k = \begin{bmatrix}	x   \\	y   \\	v_x \\	v_y \end{bmatrix}_k, \quadF = \begin{bmatrix}	1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\	0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\	0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\end{align*}assuming constant velocities, and that time is measured in frames.$w_k$ is the \textit{process noise} associated with random events or forcesthat directly affect the actual state of the system. We assume that the components of $w_k$ have Gaussian distribution $N(0, Q_k)$ for some $4$-by-$4$ covariance matrix $Q_k$. We set the matrix $Q$ with the following values:\begin{align*}Q = \begin{bmatrix}	1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\	0 & 0 & 10 & 0 \\	0 & 0 & 0 & 10 	\end{bmatrix}\end{align*}The larger variance values indicate the greater uncertainty in the velocities asthey may not be constant.\subsubsection{Evaluation}We evaluate the accuracy of our fingertip tracking method by comparing thedetected fingertip position with the manually labeled position in a sequence ofvideo frames. In this first evaluation, only one extended finger is used. Ourmethod finds all the labeled fingertips and the average error (Euclean distance)is 5.3px which is about 10mm. In their finger click evaluation, Harrison et al.reports that their system has an average of 11.7mm offset from the targets. Here we want to emphasize that the focus of the thesis is gesture recognitionand finding a hand model that is suitable for gestural input. As a result, weare not pushing the accuracy of fingertip and click detections to as high aspossible. We also envision that better touch screen hardware will be developedin the near future with larger size and higher resolution, and hence, touchdetection accuracy can be very high. Our hand model and gesture analysisframework should be general enough such that it can be easily adapted todifferent sensor inputs.\section{Hand Tracking for Seated Interaction with Vertical Display}\subsection{Gesture Salience Detection}Similar to Marcos-Ramiro et al.~\cite{marcos2013}, we define gesture\textit{salience} as a function of both the closeness of the motion to theobserver (e.g., the camera) and the magnitude of the motion.There are 4 steps in our method (Figure~\ref{fig:gesture-salience}).\begin{figure*}[tb]\centering\hspace{-0.6em}%\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.19\linewidth]{figures/color.eps}\hspace{-0.6em}%\label{fig:color}}\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.19\linewidth]{figures/depth.eps}\hspace{-0.6em}\label{fig:skin-mask}}\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.19\linewidth]{figures/motion-mask1.eps}\hspace{-0.6em}\label{fig:motion-mask}}\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.19\linewidth]{figures/salient-map.eps}\hspace{-0.6em}\label{fig:salience}}\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.19\linewidth]{figures/bounding-box.eps}\label{fig:camshift}}\caption{Gesture salience detection steps: \subref{fig:color} RGB image under low lighting condition;\subref{fig:skin-mask} depth map $D_t$ filtered by skin and user mask, $M_t^{S\wedge U}$.

(Best viewed incolor. Based on data from ChAirGest corpus~\cite{Ruffieux2013}.)}\label{fig:gesture-salience}\end{figure*}\subsubsection{Skin Segmentation}We use an off-the-shelf simple skin color detection method to compute a binary skin mask attime $t$, $M_t^S$, based on the RGB image. We also find the user mask, $M_t^U$ obtained from the Kinect SDK based on the depth image.We align the two to find their intersection $M_t^{S\wedge U}$, which indicates the user's skin region.\subsubsection{Motion Detection}The depth data is first clipped to a maximum value $\text{depth}_\text{max}$ of2m and then scaled to a value between 0 and 255 (1 byte):\begin{align*}\text{scaled} = (\text{depth}_\text{max} -\text{depth}_\text{clipped}) \times 255 / \text{depth}_\text{max}\end{align*}The scaled value is inversely proportional to the depth value.We compute the motion mask for the current depth frame based on 3 frames. We first filter eachdepth frame by the user and skin mask $M_t^{S\wedge U}$, and thensmooth it through a median filter to obtain $D_t$ (Figure~\ref{fig:skin-mask}).Equation~(\ref{eq:motion-mask}) computes the binary mask, $M_{t\vee t-1}^M$,indicating pixels whose depth values have changed from time $t-1$ to $t$ (Figure~\ref{fig:motion-mask}).$D_{t\vee t-1}$ is the absolute difference between $D_t$ and $D_{t-1}$, and $T$ is the threshold operator that filters out small changes in depth value(with a threshold of 15mm).To obtain the motion mask, $M_{t}^M$ for time $t$ only, we use $M_{t-1\vee t-2}^M$, the motion mask for $t-1$ and $t-2$ as well (see Equation~(\ref{eq:motion-mask-t}), AND and XOR are indicated by $\wedge$ and $\oplus$).\begin{align}M_{t\vee t-1}^M &= T(D_{t\vee t-1}) \label{eq:motion-mask} \\M_{t}^M &= M_{t\vee t-1}^M \oplus (M_{t\vee t-1}^M \wedge M_{t-1\vee t-2}^M) \label{eq:motion-mask-t}\end{align}\subsubsection{Salience Map}We compute histograms of depth values in both $D_t$ and $D_{t\vee t-1}$ and then apply histogram normalization to obtain cumulative distributions $H_t$ and $H_{t\vee t-1}$.$H_t$ represents the probability of salience given a depth value, while $H_{t\vee t-1}$ represents the probability of salience givena depth difference value. The lower the depth value or the higher the depth difference value, the higher the salience probability. We usehistogram equalization to reduce the effect of outliers, so that a single large depth value will not suppress the salience probabilities of other depth values.The salience map (Figure~\ref{fig:salience}) can then be computed for each pixel $(x, y)$:\begin{align*}S_t(x, y) = H_t(D_t(x, y)) \times H_{t\vee t-1}(D_{t\vee t-1}(x, y)) \times M_t^M\end{align*}The multiplication of the binary motion mask $M_t^M$ allows us to consider only the motion due to the user at $t$.\subsubsection{Salience Location}The final step of locating the most salient region in a frame is finding thecontour, $C_t$, from the salience map $S_t$ that has a perimeter greater thanthe smallest possible hand perimeter and with the highest average salience for all the pixels inside the contour.When motion is slow, the motion mask usually indicates the edge of the movingobject. As a result, the center of $C_t$ may not be the center of the movingobject (in our case, the user's hand). Hence, we use 2 iterations of Camshift~\cite{Bradski98} onthe depth image $D_t$ with a starting search location at the center of $C_t$ to refinethe final bounding box, $B_t$, of gesture salience (Figure~\ref{fig:camshift}).Figure~\ref{fig:compare-skeleton} shows examples of our hand tracking result (red regions).It is more reliable than the hand joint locations from the Kinect SDK. In theExperimental Evaluation section (Section~\ref{sec:eval}), we show that using oursalience detection method to extract hand position features gives 3.7\%absolute increase in gesture recognition F1 score compared to using the handjoint position from the Kinect SDK.\begin{figure*}\centering\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.23\linewidth]{figures/rotate-color.eps} \hspace{-0.6em}}\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.23\linewidth]{figures/rotate-depth.eps} \hspace{-0.6em}}\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.23\linewidth]{figures/near-body-color.eps}\hspace{-0.6em} }\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.23\linewidth]{figures/near-body-depth.eps}\hspace{-0.6em} }\caption{Comparison of hand tracking results.
