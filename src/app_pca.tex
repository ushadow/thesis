\chapter{Review of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}\label{app:pca}
PCA computes a new basis to re-express the dataset. The new basis is a linear
combination of the original basis, and all the new basis vectors are orthonormal
and are in the directions of largest variations~\cite{shlens2005}.

Assume we have $n$ data points and each data point is represented by a feature
vector. Let matrix $X$ be the ``centered'' data (i.e., every feature has mean
0), where columns are data points and rows are features, then $n\Sigma = XX^T$,
where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of the data and $n$ is the number of
data points. The principal components of the data are the eigenvectors of
$\Sigma$.

Since $XX^T$ and $\Sigma$ are real symmetric matrices, their eigenvectors can be
chosen such that they are real, orthogonal to each other and have norm one. Let
$Q_X\Lambda_X Q_X^T$ be the  eigendecomposition of $XX^T$ and $Q\Lambda Q^T$ be
the eigendecomposition of $\Sigma$, and $Q_X$ and $Q$ have unit column
vectors, then we have
\begin{align*}
nQ\Lambda Q^T &= Q_X\Lambda_X Q_X^T  \\
\Lambda &= \frac{1}{n}\Lambda_X \\
Q &= Q_X
\end{align*}

This shows that PCA is invariant to the scaling of the data, and will return the
same eigenvectors regardless of the scaling of the input~\cite{pca14}. Only the
eigenvalues will be scaled by the same factor if the input is scaled. 

The total variance in the data is defined as the sum of the variances
of the individual components. variation explained, $k$ principal components.

\begin{align}
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_i}
\end{align}
