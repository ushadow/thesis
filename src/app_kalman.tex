\chapter{Review of Kalman Filter}\label{app:kalman}
This chapter is based on the OpenCV book~\cite{Opencv}. The Kalman filter is an
algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing
noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that
tend to be more precise than those based on a single measurement
alone~\cite{kalman14}.
Let $\underline{x}_t$ be an $d$-dimensional vector of state components of a
system.
Assuming no external control, the a priori estimate $
\underline{x}_t^-$ of the state is
given by:
\begin{align*}
\underline{x}_t^- = F\underline{x}_{t - 1} + \underline{w}_t,
\end{align*}
where $F$ is the $d$-by-$d$ \textit{transfer matrix} characterizing the
dynamics of the system, and $\underline{w}_t$ is the \textit{process noise}
associated with random events or forces that directly affect the actual state of
the system. We assume that the components of $\underline{w}_k$ have Gaussian
distribution $N(\underline{0}, Q_t)$ for some $d$-by-$d$ covariance matrix $Q_t$.

Using $P_t^-$ to denote the error covariance, the a priori estimate for this
covariance at time $t$ is obtained from the value at time $t - 1$ by:
\begin{align*}
P_t^- = FP_{t - 1}F^T + Q_{t - 1}
\end{align*}

In general, we make measurement $\underline{z}_t$ that may or may not be the
direct measurements of the state variable $\underline{x}_t$. The measurement
$\underline{z}_t$ is an $m$-dimensional vector given by:
\begin{align*}
\underline{z}_t = H_t\underline{x}_t + \underline{v}_t,
\end{align*}
where $H_t$ is an $m$-by-$d$ matrix and $\underline{v}_k$ is the measurement
error.

The \textit{Kalman gain}, $K_t$, is an $d$-by-$m$ matrix,  
\begin{align*}
K_t = P_t^-H_t^T(H_tP_t^-H_t^T + R_t)^{-1}
\end{align*}
It tells us how to
weight new information against what we think we already know.
The updated value for $\underline{x}_k$ when a new measurement is available is:
\begin{align*}
\underline{x}_t = \underline{x}_t^- + K_t(\underline{z}_t^- -
H_t\underline{x}_t^-)
\end{align*}
The update value for $P_t$ is:
\begin{align*}
P_t = (I - K_tH_t)P_t^-
\end{align*}
